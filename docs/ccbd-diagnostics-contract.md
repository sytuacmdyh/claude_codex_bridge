# CCBD Diagnostics Contract

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the non-drifting diagnostics contract for project-scoped startup/shutdown reports, backend logs, and support-bundle export in `ccb_source`.

It is the authoritative design anchor for:

- `.ccb/ccbd/startup-report.json`
- `.ccb/ccbd/shutdown-report.json`
- `.ccb/ccbd/state.json`
- `.ccb/ccbd/start-policy.json`
- `.ccb/ccbd/lifecycle.jsonl`
- `.ccb/ccbd/heartbeats/<subject-kind>/*.json`
- project-scoped backend log retention under `.ccb/ccbd/`
- `ccb doctor`
- `ccb doctor ps`
- `ccb doctor logs <agent>`
- `ccb doctor --bundle`

The repo-local memory file [AGENTS.md](/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/AGENTS.md) must point to this document instead of duplicating the rules.

## 2. Goals

Diagnostics must let another user reproduce backend state and failure context without interactive shell access to the original machine.

That means the diagnostics surface must answer at least:

- what the project anchor was
- which config was active
- whether the backend was mounted, restarted, recovered, or shut down
- which agents were expected, mounted, degraded, or stopped
- what the daemon and keeper most recently logged
- which authority files and event streams existed at the time of export

## 3. Hard Contract

### 3.1 Project Scope

- Diagnostics are scoped to one `.ccb` anchor.
- All project diagnostics records must live under that anchor's logical `.ccb/ccbd/`, even when the physical runtime state root is relocated on WSL mounted-drive projects.
- Runtime-root marker and reference files are part of the project diagnostics evidence chain and must be mapped back into the logical `.ccb` archive path in support bundles.
- Project-local provider state under `.ccb/agents/<agent>/provider-state/` is diagnostics evidence and should be exported when it is relevant to session isolation or binding analysis.
- Diagnostics export must never merge multiple project anchors into one bundle.

### 3.2 Startup Report

Path:

- `.ccb/ccbd/startup-report.json`

The latest startup report must capture the most recent startup-related transaction, including:

- `trigger`
  - at minimum `daemon_boot` or `start_command`
- `status`
  - at minimum `ok` or `failed`
- `generated_at`
- `daemon_generation`
- optional `daemon_started`
  - whether the foreground `ccb` command had to start a new daemon
- `requested_agents`
- `desired_agents`
- `actions_taken`
- `agent_results`
- `inspection`
- `socket_placement`
  - at minimum preferred/effective socket paths plus root kind and fallback reason for both `ccbd` and project tmux socket selection
- optional `failure_reason`

Rules:

- daemon boot must write a startup report
- foreground `start` must overwrite it with the more specific `start_command` report
- startup report write failure must not replace the original startup error with a diagnostics-only error
- when project tmux preparation fails, `failure_reason` must preserve the user-facing startup failure plus tmux command context, the effective tmux socket path, socket path byte length when known, and original tmux stderr/stdout detail when available

### 3.3 Shutdown Report

Path:

- `.ccb/ccbd/shutdown-report.json`

The latest shutdown report must capture the most recent shutdown-related transaction, including:

- `trigger`
  - at minimum `shutdown`, `stop_all`, `kill`, or `kill_fallback`
- `status`
- `generated_at`
- `forced`
- `stopped_agents`
- `actions_taken`
- `cleanup_summaries`
- `inspection_after`
- optional `failure_reason`

Rules:

- normal server-side stop/shutdown must write a shutdown report
- CLI fallback kill must also write a shutdown report
- the final persisted shutdown report must reflect post-shutdown state, not an intermediate pre-unmount snapshot

### 3.4 Backend Logs

Project backend logs must remain under `.ccb/ccbd/`:

- `ccbd.stdout.log`
- `ccbd.stderr.log`
- `keeper.stdout.log`
- `keeper.stderr.log`

Rules:

- daemon and keeper must append logs to stable file paths
- diagnostics readers must treat these as evidence, not authority
- large logs may be tailed during export, but the manifest must explicitly mark truncation

### 3.5 Namespace State And Lifecycle

Paths:

- `.ccb/ccbd/state.json`
- `.ccb/ccbd/start-policy.json`
- `.ccb/ccbd/lifecycle.jsonl`
- `.ccb/ccbd/heartbeats/<subject-kind>/*.json`

Rules:

- `state.json` records the latest persisted project tmux namespace facts
- `start-policy.json` records the persisted project recovery startup policy, including inherited `auto_permission` and forced recovery-restore semantics
- `lifecycle.jsonl` records namespace creation/destruction and later runtime lifecycle events
- `heartbeats/<subject-kind>/*.json` records non-lease heartbeat state for long-lived supervised subjects such as running jobs; these files are diagnostics/evidence, not backend ownership authority
- daemon lease heartbeat and subject heartbeat must remain separate concepts and separate files
- `doctor` and bundle export must include these records when present
- `ping('ccbd')` and `doctor` should surface start-policy summary fields when available
- `ping('ccbd')` and `doctor` must surface namespace summary fields such as epoch, tmux socket path, session name, and latest lifecycle event when available
- `ping('ccbd')` and `doctor` must surface current socket placement diagnostics, including preferred/effective socket path, root kind, fallback reason, and filesystem hint when known
- `doctor` must also surface preferred/effective socket path byte lengths and an equivalent `tmux -S <effective-socket> start-server` command when a project tmux socket path is known, so macOS and WSL socket pathname failures can be diagnosed from one report
- malformed namespace diagnostics must surface as diagnostics errors, not silently disappear
- supervision diagnostics must preserve mount-attempt distinctions:
  - `mount_started` details should include `mount_attempt_id` when present
  - superseded finalize paths should remain visible as `mount_superseded`
    instead of collapsing into missing history

### 3.6 Doctor Read Path

`ccb doctor` is the best-effort project diagnostics read path.

Rules:

- it must summarize current backend inspection plus latest persisted reports
- `doctor ps` and `doctor logs <agent>` are converged diagnostics subviews of
  the same diagnostics surface
- if top-level `ps` and `logs` are retained, they must remain compatibility
  entrypoints over the same diagnostics meaning rather than drifting into a
  second independent diagnostics surface
- it should surface current mailbox summary authority for configured agents when
  present, including at minimum summary version/source/freshness plus head and
  queue facts needed to diagnose summary-vs-ledger drift
- it should also surface mailbox summary consistency status for configured
  agents by comparing persisted summary authority against a diagnostics-grade
  ledger projection without mutating mailbox artifacts
- missing, unreadable, or drifted mailbox summaries must remain visible in
  doctor output as explicit consistency mismatch/error state rather than being
  silently repaired during the read path
- agent binding diagnostics must include both `tmux_socket_name` and `tmux_socket_path` when known so project-scoped namespace bugs can be diagnosed from logs alone
- startup failure diagnostics must retain chained cause detail in CLI output and in `ccbd_startup_last_failure_reason` when the backend recorded it
- Codex agent diagnostics should surface managed in-pane session-switch state
  when `.ccb/agents/<agent>/provider-runtime/codex/session-switch.json`
  exists, including state, reason, commit status, and candidate session
  identity
- `doctor storage` must surface the effective `shared_cache_root`,
  `shared_cache_root_usable`, and shared-cache status/reason, so WSL relocation
  and future provider cache sharing decisions are diagnosable from the same
  storage view. When the reason is `wsl_drvfs_requires_runtime_relocation`, the
  root must be reported as unavailable instead of pointing at an unsafe drvfs
  path. Supported disabled reason codes are `not_implemented`,
  `not_implemented_runtime_relocated`, and
  `wsl_drvfs_requires_runtime_relocation`.
- it must not crash only because one diagnostics artifact is missing or malformed
- malformed diagnostics files must surface as diagnostics errors, not silent omission

### 3.7 Support Bundle Export

Command:

- `ccb doctor --bundle`

Default output location:

- `.ccb/ccbd/support/<bundle-id>.tar.gz`

The support bundle must include:

- a manifest
- a generated doctor snapshot
- current project config from `.ccb/ccb.config`
- latest lifecycle reports
- backend authority files such as lease, keeper, shutdown intent, and namespace state when present
- backend recovery policy authority such as `start-policy.json` when present
- persisted non-lease heartbeat state under `.ccb/ccbd/heartbeats/` when present
- recent backend event streams such as supervision, namespace lifecycle, and cleanup history
- backend stdout/stderr logs
- per-agent runtime authority and recent agent/provider logs
- non-secret project-local provider-state evidence such as managed Codex homes, session roots, session logs, and config overlays
- a generated storage classification snapshot at
  `generated/storage-summary.json`
- relevant external session files when discoverable from runtime authority

Rules:

- bundle export must be best-effort and continue when some files are missing or malformed
- manifest rows must include original source path, archive path, inclusion status, and truncation status
- bundle export must not require the backend to be healthy
- bundle export must be project-local and deterministic enough for support usage
- provider-state export must exclude credential material such as copied auth
  tokens and provider-managed credential files like `auth.json` or
  `oauth_creds.json`; Gemini projected auth artifacts such as `.env` and
  `google_accounts.json` must also be excluded
- provider-state export must use the storage classification model from
  [docs/ccb-provider-state-storage-boundary-plan.md](/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/docs/ccb-provider-state-storage-boundary-plan.md)
  to exclude `SECRET`, `REBUILDABLE_CACHE`, and
  `STARTUP_AUTHORITY_BUNDLE` payload files from the archive while preserving
  their path/class/size metadata in `generated/storage-summary.json`
- if storage classification fails, provider-state export must still apply a
  conservative path hard-filter for known cache/startup-bundle directories such
  as Codex `.tmp/plugins/`, Claude `.local/share/claude/versions/`, and
  Gemini/npm rebuildable cache paths; classification failure must not turn
  excluded payloads into archive entries
- provider-state export must not follow symlinks while walking provider-state
  trees
- Codex managed-home violations must remain visible as diagnostics evidence; bundle export must not hide them by silently replacing the managed reader source with global `~/.codex/sessions`

### 3.8 Keeper Child Reaping

The keeper may directly spawn `ccbd`, but it must reap exited direct children.

Rule:

- a crashed or killed `ccbd` process must not remain visible as an unreaped zombie just because keeper is still alive

## 4. Operational Workflow

Recommended support workflow:

1. reproduce the issue in the project anchor
2. run `ccb doctor`
3. run `ccb doctor --bundle`
4. send the generated tarball

The bundle is the transport unit. The reports inside it are the authoritative timeline.

## 5. Update Discipline

- If startup or shutdown reporting changes, update this document in the same patch.
- If `doctor` or bundle contents change materially, update this document in the same patch.
- Use [docs/ccbd-manual-test-issue-log.md](/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/docs/ccbd-manual-test-issue-log.md) for concrete incidents and repro findings.
